# 🧠 Stress Level Predictor (with Scenario Testing)

An interactive **Streamlit web app** that predicts student **stress levels (Low, Medium, High)** from psychological, social, and lifestyle factors.  
The app also includes a unique **Scenario Testing Optimiser** that suggests small lifestyle/academic tweaks (e.g., better sleep, more social support) and shows how those changes could reduce stress probability.

## 📊 Why this matters

Understanding **why** a model predicts higher stress can help:

- 🎓 **Educators** support students with academic pressure  
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Psychologists** identify high-risk cases early  
- 🏢 **Organisations** design better workplace wellness interventions
